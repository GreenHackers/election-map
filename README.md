## Myanmar Election Map

> An example how to use MaePaySoh API on web. Based on Polymer Starter Kit.

### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x.

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the election map's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd election-map && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Polymer

This app build using Polymer based on Polymer Starter Kit. You can read more about Polymer Starter Kit on [https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit)

## Application Theming

Polymer 1.0 introduces a shim for CSS custom properties. We take advantage of this in `app/styles/app-theme.html` to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.

[Read more](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html) about CSS custom properties.

## Unit Testing

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

## Dependency Management

Polymer uses [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies.
